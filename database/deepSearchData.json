frequent breaking changes its an lts feature  q can zap build with zigs master branch  see the zigmaster branch an example of how to use it is herehttpsgithubcomzigzaphellomaster please note that the

calculate sum of binary tree of 100m nodes with spicebenchspicetreesum100msvg spice uses heartbeat schedulinghb to accomplish extremely efficient parallelism in zig  subnanosecond overhead turning your function into a parallelismenabled function adds less than a nanosecond of overhead  contentionfree threads will never compete ie spin over the same work adding more threads to the system will not make your program any slower but the extra threads might be completely idle since theres nothing useful to do update september 2024 chilihttpsgithubcomdragostischili is a rust port of the ideas presented here check it out the benchmark in the figure above summing over the nodes in a binary tree is typically one of the worst cases for parallelism frameworks the actual operation is extremely fast so any sort of overhead will have a measurable impact heres the exact same benchmark in rayonrayon an excellent library in rust for doing parallelism both implementations follow the same forkjoin api which gives code that is very easy to read and reason about none of the findings here would surprise anyone who deeply knows rayon and there are ways of getting better performance out of rayon by using different techniques this comes at cost of the code becoming more complicated andor behaving subpar on different types of input the purpose of this benchmark is to not discourage use of rayon on the contrary but rather demonstrate that it is possible to have both simple code and good parallelism see issue 5httpsgithubcomjudofyrspiceissues5 for a longer discussion time to calculate sum of binary tree of 100m nodes with rayonbenchrayontreesum100msvg the overhead here is roughly 15 ns from 748 ns to 2299 ns which means that at 4 threads were back to the sequential performance  just using four times as much cpu luckily we are able to get linear speedup in terms of threads initially these benchmarks were ran on a c4standard16 instance in google cloud with 16 cores rayon itself shows a nice 14x speedup from 2299 ns to 164 ns at 16 threads but compared to the baseline this ends up only being 45x due to the overhead in comparison spice scales slightly worse it only got 11x speedup when going from 1 to 16 threads however due its low overhead this is also essentially the speedup compared to the baseline its not entirely clear why the zig baseline implementation is twice as fast as the rust implementation the compiled assembly godboltrustvszig show that rust saves five registers on the stack while zig only saves three but why for the purpose of this benchmark it shouldnt matter since were only comparing against the baseline of each language it becomes even more interesting if were summing the nodes of a much smaller tree time to calculate sum of binary tree of 1000 nodes with rayonbenchrayontreesum1000svg in this scenario we have a very short duration of our program the baseline implementation takes a few microseconds in total to run for some reason the overhead is a bit higher 19 ns but more concerningly we see that performance becomes worse the more threads were adding at 32 threads its in total 60 times slower in this case were using 32 threads on a machine which only has 16 cores its not given that we would see the same slowdown for a machine with 32 cores nonetheless this scaling behavior is concerning the conventional wisdom for parallelism therefore ends up being its not worth it unless you have enough work to parallelize the example above is typically presented as a bad fit for parallelism this is understandable and pragmatic but in practice it makes it a lot more difficult to actually parallelize your code  what exactly is enough work you might need to do a lot of benchmarking with different types of input to understand this  it might be difficult to detect how much work a certain input does for instance in our binary tree we dont know the full size of it theres no obvious way for us to say if the tree is small enough dont run the parallelized code since by only looking at the root we dont the size of it  as weve seen the potential slowdown can be extreme what if 90 of your workload is like this  as your program evolves and your code does more or less things the definition of enough work will also naturally change the goal of spice is for you to never have to worry about your program becoming slower by making it parallel if youre looking to maximize the performance you should of course do elaborate benchmarking but generally with spice you can add parallelism and there will be practically no overhead the last example of summing over 1000 nodes behaves as follows in spice time to calculate sum of binary tree of 1000 nodes with spicebenchspicetreesum1000svg whats happening here is that its discovering that the duration is too short so none of the multithreading kicks in all the extra threads here are sleeping giving the cores time to execute other programs spice is primarily a research project read

documentationhttpsrockoragergithubiolibvaxisvaxisvaxis starter repohttpsgithubcomrockoragerlibvaxisstarter vaxis requires three basic primitives to operate 1 a tty instance 2 an instance of vaxis 3 an event loop the library provides a general purpose posix tty implementation as well as a multithreaded event loop implementation users of the library are encouraged to use the event loop of their choice the event loop is responsible for reading the tty passing the read bytes to the vaxis parser and handling events a core feature of vaxis is its ability to detect features via terminal queries instead of relying on a terminfo database this requires that the event loop also handle these query responses and update the vaxiscaps struct accordingly see the loop implementation to see how this is done if writing your own event loop  example zig const std  importstd const vaxis  importvaxis const cell  vaxiscell const textinput  vaxiswidgetstextinput const border  vaxiswidgetsborder  this can contain internal events as well as vaxis events  internal events can be posted into the same queue as vaxis events to allow  for a single event loop with exhaustive switching booya const event

the application to ensure that all  resizes occur in the main thread this lets us avoid expensive  locks on the screen all applications must handle this event  unless they arent using a screen ie only detecting features   the allocations are because we keep a copy of each cell to  optimize renders when resize is called we allocated two slices  one for the screen and one for our buffered screen each cell in  the buffered screen contains an arraylistu8 to be able to store  the grapheme for that cell each cell is initialized with a size  of 1 which is sufficient for all of ascii anything requiring  more than one byte will incur an allocation on the first render  after it is drawn thereafter it will not allocate unless the  screen is resized winsize  ws try vxresizealloc ttyanywriter ws else

documentationhttpsgithubcomnatecraddockzfblobmasterdoczfmd  library documentationhttpsgithubcomnatecraddockzfblobmasterdoclibmd  why use zf zf was designed knowing that a frequent use case for fuzzy finders is filtering filepaths it also works great for any arbitrary string but it is especially good at filtering filepaths with precision specifically  matches on filenames are prioritized over filepath matches  matches on the beginning of a word are prioritized over matches in the middle of a word  nonsequential character matches are penalized  strict path matching offers even more precision here are some concrete examples  filename priority the query is matched first on the filename and then on the path if the filename doesnt match this example comes from blenders source code and was my original inspiration for designing zf text  make gnumakefile sourceblendermakesdnadnagenfileh sourceblendermakesdnainterndnagenfilec sourceblendermakesrnainternrnacachefilec sourceblendermakesdnadnacurveprofiletypesh  fzf and fzy both rank sourceblendermakesdnadnagenfileh first in the results with gnumakefile 10 items down the list  spaceseparated tokens but not every filename is unique sometimes there are codebases where there are many files with the same or similar names like an initpy in python or c and h file pairs in c in zf each space separated query term is used to narrow down the results imagine searching for an initpy file in a python project text  init initpy uiinitpy datainitpy configinitpy  at this point you can either move the selection down with kdbdownkbd or cn to find configinitpy or you can add a new token to the query string text  init c configinitpy  treating the query string as a sequence of tokens makes filtering more efficient  strict path matching this feature is a do what i mean feature more easily used than explained when the query looks like a path contains at least one path separator strict path matching is enabled path segments are the portions of a path delimited by path separators foobar has segments foo and bar with strict path matching the path segments of the query token must not span across path segments in the candidate as an example the query foo would match foobar but not foobar because the characters foo must appear in a single path segment this is useful for narrowing down results when you know the exact path structure of your files with the following paths  appmodelsfoobarbazrb appmodelsfoobarbazrb appmodelsfoobarbazrb appmonstersdungeonfoobarbazrb  strict path matching ensures that the intended path structure is found   amfbbaz appmodelsfoobarbazrb  in other fuzzy finders the string appmonstersdungeonfoobarbazrb is also included in the results strict path matching prevents this because there is a slash between onstersdungeon and nothing in the query matches the dungeon segment to end strict path matching just add a space to start a new query token  installation  arch linux

designed around either using the convenient image or imageunmanaged struct that can read and write image formats no matter the format  or you can also use the image format directly in case you want to

diagramhttpsgithubcomttytmwebuiassets34311583dbde35733161421e925c392a39f45ab3 div think of webui like a webview controller but instead of embedding the webview controller in your program which makes the final program big in size and nonportable as it needs the webview runtimes instead by using webui you use a tiny staticdynamic library to run any installed web browser and use it as gui which makes your program small fast and portable all it needs is a web browser  runtime dependencies comparison   tauri  webview  qt  webui            runtime dependencies on windows  webview2  qtcore qtgui

notable types you can inject are  stdmemallocator requestscoped arena allocator  tkrequest current request including headers body reader etc  tkresponse current response with methods to send data set headers etc  tkinjector the injector itself see below  and everything you provide yourself for example you can easily write a handler function which will create a string on the fly and return it to

continue with the next handler in the chain  customscoping zig doesnt have closures so we cant just capture variables from the outer scope but what we can do is to use our dependency injection context to provide some dependencies to any middleware or handler function further in the chain  middlewares do not support the shorthand syntax for dependency injection  so you need to use ctxinjectorgett to get your dependencies manually zig fn authctx context anyerrorvoid  const db  ctxinjectorgetdb const token  try jwtparsectxreqgetheaderauthorization const user  dbfinduser tokenid catch null return

contributing you are welcome to contribute to this repo ","arwalk/zig-protobuf":"a protobuf 3 implementation for zig.  zigprotobuf   welcome this is an implementation of google protocol buffers version 3 in zig protocol buffers is a serialization protocol so systems from any programming language or platform can exchange data reliably protobufs strength lies in a generic codec paired with userdefined messages that will define the true nature of the data encoded messages are usually mapped to a native languages structureclass definition thanks to a languagespecific generator associated with an implementation zigs compiletime evaluation becomes extremely strong and useful in this context because the structure a message has to be known beforehand the generic codec can leverage informations at compile time of the message and its nature this allows optimizations that are hard to get as easily in any other language as zig can mix compiletime informations with runtimeonly data

programming language meant to be embedded into games to be programmed by the players the compiler and runtime are implemented in zig and c  short example js var list   hello world  fortext in list  printtext   you can find more examples in the examplesexampleslola folder  why lola when there is x lola isnt meant to be your next best daytoday scripting language its design is focused on embedding the language in environments where the users wantneedshould write some small scripts like games or scriptable applications in most script languages you as a script host dont have control over the execution time of the scripts youre executing lola protects you against programming errors like endless loops and such  controlled execution environment every script invocation gets a limit of instructions it might execute when either this limit is reached or the script yields for other reasons asynchronous functions the execution is returned to the host this means you can execute the following script in parallel to your application main loop without blocking your application and without requiring complex multithreading setups js var timer  0 whiletrue  printscript running for  timer  seconds timer  1 sleep10    native asynchronous design lola features both synchronous and asynchronous host functions synchronous host function calls are shortlived and will be executed inplace asynchronous functions in contrast will be executed multiple times until they yield a value when they dont yield a value control will be returned to the script host this script will not exhaust the instruction limit but will only increment the counter then return control back to the host js var counter  0 whiletrue  counter  1 yield   this behaviour can be utilized to wait for certain events in the host environment for example to react to key presses a script could look like this js whiletrue  var input  waitforkey ifinput     printspace was pressed    note that the current implementation is not threadsafe but requires to use the limited execution for running scripts in parallel  native rpc design lola also allows executing multiple scripts on the same environment meaning that you can easily create crossscript communications js  script a var buffer function setval  buffer  val  function get  return val   script b  getbuffer returns a object referencing a environment for script a var buffer  getbuffer buffersethello world  script c  getbuffer returns a object referencing a environment for script a var buffer  getbuffer printbuffer contains  bufferget  with a fitting network stack and library this can even be utilized crosscomputer this example implements a small chat client and server that could work with lola rpc capabilities js  chat client implementation var server

   serializable state as lola has no reference semantics except for objects it is easy to understand and learn it is also simple in its implementation and does not require a complex garbage collector or advanced programming knowledge each lola value can be serializeddeserialized into a sequence of bytes only exception are object handles those require some special attention so saving the current state of a environmentvm to disk and loading it at a later point is a firstclass supported use case this is especially useful for games where it is favourable to save your script state into a save game as well without having any drawbacks  simple error handling lola provides little to no inlanguage error handling as its not designed to be robust against user programming errors each error is passed to the host as a panic so it can show the user that there was an error like outofmemory or typemismatch inlanguage error handling is based on the dynamic typing functions that allow inlanguage error handling just return void instead of a actual return value or truefalse for success or failure this allows simple error checking like this js var string  readfiledemodata ifstring  void  printfile contained  string   this design decision was made with the idea in mind that most lola programmers wont write the next best security critical software but just do a quick hack in game to reach their next item unlock  smart compiler as lola isnt the most complex language the compiler can support the programmer even though the language has fully dynamic typing the compiler can do some type checking at compile time already js  warning possible type mismatch detected expected numberstringarray found boolean ifa  true    right now this is only used for validating expressions but it is planned to extend this behaviour to annotate variables as well so even more type errors can be found during compile time note that this is a fairly new feature it does not catch all your type mismatches but can prevent the obvious ones  starting points to get familiar with lola you can check out these starting points  documentationdocumentationreadmemd  lola examplesexampleslolareadmemd

creating a drawing context the drawing context is created using a backendspecific initialization function if youre using the opengl backend the context is created as follows zig const nvg  importnanovg  var vg  try nvgglinitallocator  debug  true  defer vgdeinit  the second parameter defines options for creating the renderer  antialias means that the renderer adjusts the geometry to include antialiasing if youre using msaa you can omit this option to be default initialized as false  stencilstrokes means that the render uses better quality rendering for overlapping strokes the quality is mostly visible on wider strokes if you want speed you can omit this option to be default initialized as false currently there is an opengl backend for nanovg nanovgglzigsrcnanovgglzig for opengl 20 and webgl webgl is automatically chosen when targeting webassembly theres an interface called params defined in internalzigsrcinternalzig which can be implemented by additional backends note

a blank slate there are a number of functions to define the path to draw such as rectangle rounded rectangle and ellipse or you can use the common moveto lineto bezierto and arcto api to compose a path stepbystep  understanding composite paths because of the way the rendering backend is built in nanovg drawing a composite path  that is a path consisting of multiple paths defining holes and fills  is a bit more involved nanovg uses the evenodd filling rule and by default the paths are wound in counterclockwise order keep that in mind when drawing using the lowlevel drawing api in order

event loop in zig using io_uring and coroutines  overview asynciouring is an event loop that wraps the iouring library with coroutines support it supports all iouring operations with the intentional exception of pollupdate in addition it allows  adding timeouts to operations  manual cancellation of operations  writing custom operations for advanced use cases it is currently functionally complete though there are a few todos marked in the source related to polishing the api its not used in production anywhere currently see srcasynciouringzig for full api documentation see the examples directory for an echo client and server that use the event loop  if you need this for some reason please create an issue  warning the main branch of asynciouring will follow changes to zigs master

091  table of contents  backgroundbackground  goalsgoals  installationinstallation  example usageexampleusage  echo clientechoclient  operation timeoutsoperationcancellation  operation cancellationoperationcancellation   background as an overview for the unfamiliar iouring is a newish linux kernel feature that allows users to enqueue requests to perform syscalls into a submission queue eg a request to read from a socket and then submit the submission queue to the kernel for processing when requests from the submission queue have been satisfied the result is placed onto completion queue by the kernel the user is able to either poll the kernel for completion queue results or block until results are available zigs iouring library provides a convenient interface to the kernels iouring functionality the user of iouring however still has to manually deal with submitting requests to the kernel and retrieving events from the completion queue which can be tedious this library wraps the iouring library by adding an event loop that handles request submission and completion and provides an interface for each syscall that uses zigs async functionality to suspend execution of the calling code until the syscall has been completed this lets the user write code that looks like blocking code while still allowing for concurrency even within a single thread  goals  minimal wraps the iouring library in the most lightweight way possible this means it still uses the iouring data structures in many places like for completion queue entries there are no additional internal data structures other than the submission queue and completion queue used by the iouring library this means theres no heap allocation it also relies entirely on kernel functionality for timeouts and cancellation  complete you should be able to do anything with this that you could do with iouring  easy to use because of the use of coroutines code written with this library looks almost identical to blocking code in addition operation timeouts and cancellation support is integrated into the api for all operations  performant the library does no heap allocation and theres minimal additional logic on top of suspendresume  installation this library integrates with the zigmodhttpsgithubcomnektrozigmod package manager if youve installed zigmod you can add a line like the following to your rootdependencies in the zigmod file of your project and run zigmod fetch yml rootdependencies    src git httpsgithubcomsaltzmasynciouringgit  youll then be able to include asynciouringzig by doing something like zig const io  importasynciouring  the examples directory is structured roughly as you might structure a project that uses asynciouring with a working zigmod file and buildzig that can serve as examples youll also need a linux kernel version that supports all of the iouring features youd like to use all testing was done on version 5130  example usage  echo client jumping right

also serves as examples  motivation using an fsm library may have some benefits over handwritten state machines  many realworld processes algorithms and protocols have rigorously defined state machines available these can be imported directly or programmatically into zigfsm  can lead to significant simplification of code as transition rules are explicitly stated in one place contrast this with the brittleness of manually checking and documenting which states can follow a certain state when a certain event happens  an invalid state transition is an immediate error with useful contextual information  you get visualization for free which is helpful during development debugging and as documentation  using zigfsm before diving into code its worth repeating that zigfsm state machines can generate their own diagram as well as import them this can be immensely helpful when working on your state machines as you get a simple visualization of all transitions and events obviously the diagrams can be used as part of your documentation as well heres the diagram from the csv parser test as generated by the library

playstation portable! h1 aligncenterzigpsph1 p aligncentera project to bring zig to the sony playstation portablep  why zig on the psp in the psp programming community many libraries tools and other features are written in c or c which as we know has its problems with writing clean reusable and high quality code given that the core objectives of zig as a language are to allow us to create welldesigned and reusable software zig seems like a perfect fit for integrating older psp libraries while striving to develop higher quality software  special thanks special thanks is given to the rustpsp teamhttpsgithubcomoverdrivenpotatorustpsp whose efforts influenced and helped to get this project off the ground no harm is intended and its thanks to you rustaceans that fellow ziguanas can program for the psp  usage currently using zigpsp is rather straight forward  one must use the psp folder in their projects src folder in order to have the psps function definitions alongside with some custom utilities i have created one also must include the tools folder to use the postbuild tools to build a psp app use the included buildzig script to generate a psp executable ebootpbp  appprx this script is well commented for explanation and documentation for a mainzig file one should include something like zig const psp  importpsputilspspzig comptime  asmpspmoduleinfozig psp app 0 1 0  pub fn main void  psputilsenablehbcb pspdebugscreeninit pspdebugprinthello from zig   a quick call to zig build will build your program and should emit an ebootpbp and appprx in your root these are the two psp executable formats  prx for debugging and pbp for running normally one can run a pbp file on their psp assuming cfw is installed by adding their application to pspdrivepspgameyourappnameebootpbp and it will be available under the gamesmemory stick list in the psps xmb  eboot customization in order to customize the eboot one can look into the buildzig file and modify the constant fields to change their application icon background and even add animations or sounds to the eboot on the xmb screen  comparisons to cc when comparing zig code to cc it would be rather apparent that by default zig is much smaller and tightly knit llvm is an excellent backend which produces some very small code and zig is an example of that without the weight of the entire c standard library needing to be imported a simple naive hello world as seen above generates in 10195 bytes compared to the cc size of 68098 bytes thats an 85 reduction in size with a few structural changes as seen in hellominzig sample that size can get down to 6674 bytes thats 902 smaller hopefully in the future one could reference track the functions used in the sdk for imports and dynamically generate module import information this way the psp applications could go as small as 3200 bytes for a hello world this repository is distributed as part of a template allowing one to customize their module imports meaning that full release applications built with small tweaks to the toolchain nids directory could result in extraordinarily small executables for release applications  documentation currently zigpsp does not include documentation of the pspsdk in the sdks zig files  but rather they are well documented in chttppspjimshpspsdkdoc it is planned to add documentation in the future to resolve this  debugging if one has an installed copy of the legacy pspsdk one can use psplink  a usb debugging software to connect their psp to their computer and run debugging functions on the application with legacy pspsdk youll also have access to pspgdb a pspspecific version of gdb to use as well pspgdb with zig is untested at the moment but in theory should work ","kassane/qml_zig":"qml

revision control and used by zigglgen  why is a threadlocal procedure table required per the opengl spec opengl function pointers loaded when one opengl context is current are not guaranteed to remain valid when a different context becomes current this means that it would be incorrect to load a single set of function pointers to global memory just once at application startup and then have them be shared by all current and future opengl contexts in order to support portable multithreaded multicontext opengl applications it must be possible to load multiple sets of function pointers because opengl contexts are already threadlocal it makes a lot of sense to handle function pointers in a similar manner  why arent opengl constants represented as zig enums the short answer is that its simply not possible to represent groups of opengl constants as zig enums in a satisfying manner  the api registry currently specifies some of these groups but far from all of them and the groups are not guaranteed to be complete groups can be extended by extensions so zig enums would need to be defined as nonexhaustive and using constants not specified as part of a group would require casting  some commands like getintegerv that can return constants will return them as plain integers ","xyaman/mibu":"pure zig library for low-level terminal manipulation.  warning  this library is a wip and may

janettablegettable key becomes tablegetkey  all bindings have idiomatic zig naming even when janet uses different ones for example arity and fixarity are arity and fixarity in zig  functions like janettable are available as tableinit please consult the source code for that  semantics  function return types return error sets as well as optional values where it makes sense to do so for example tableget returns janet and pcall returns signalerrorvoid  all types are wrapped into structs most of the types support this natively since they are structs in c too others tuple struct string keyword symbol cannot be represented as structs directly and they are wrappers with a ptr or slice field containing the original value  all functions that have a type at the end for example janetgetnumber instead use this signature getcomptime t type  currently these functions exist get opt wrap janetunwrap  when you need to supply a pointer to the array and a length in the c version in zig version you need to supply just a slice since it has both the pointer and the length so its one parameter instead of two for example c int janetdobytesjanettable env const uint8t bytes int32t len const char sourcepath janet out  becomes zig pub fn dobytesenv environment bytes const u8 sourcepath 0const u8 janet   abstracts are fully typed no void pointers to ptrcast take a look at tests for examples with abstracts they are generally reworked to make them easier to use  all functions returning signal instead return void on ok and return error otherwise with the specified signal signature is signalerrorvoid  dostring and dobytes are aliases and return janet directly instead of accepting a reference for the return value  string keyword symbol nil toplevel functions are the only ones to create these types and they do what you want  environment type introduced which is internally a table but allows conceptually different operations such as defining values and executing code

bits unused if the largest value in an array is m then you actually only need n  log2m  1 bits per element eg if the largest value is 270 you will get 7x compression using compactarray over u64 as it stores each element using only 9 bits and 64 divided by 9 is roughly 7  zinidictarray finds all distinct elements in the array stores each once into a compactarray the dictionary and creates a new compactarray containing indexes into the dictionary this will give excellent compression if theres a lot of repetition in the original array  zinieliasfano stores increasing 64bit numbers in a compact manner  zinidarray provides constanttime support for the select1i operation which returns the ith set bit in a stddynamicbitsetunmanaged  overview  pthash minimal perfect hash function zinipthash contains an implementation of pthashpthash a minimal perfect hash functionhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiperfecthashfunction construction algorithm given a set of n elements with the only requirement being that you can hash them it generates a hash function which maps each element to a distinct number between 0 and n  1 the generated hash function is extremely small typically consuming less than 4 bits per element regardless of the size of the input type the algorithm provides multiple parameters to tune making it possible to optimize for small size short construction time or short lookup time to give a practical example in 06 seconds zini was able to create a hash function for usrsharedictwords containing 235886 words the resulting hash function required in total 865682 bits in memory this corresponds to 1082 kb in total or 367 bits per word in comparison the original file was 249 mb and compressing it with gzip 9 only gets it down to 754 kb which you cant use directly in memory without decompressing it it should of course be noted that they dont store the equivalent data as you cant use the generated hash function to determine if a word is present or not in the list the comparison is mainly useful to get a feeling of the magnitudes  bumped ribbon retrieval a retrieval data structure ziniribbon contains an implementation of bumped ribbon retrievalburr burr a retrieval data structure given n keys with the only requirement being that you can hash them which each have an rbit value well build a data structure which will return the value for all of the n keys however the keys are actually not stored were only using the hash so if you ask for the value for an unknown key you will get a seemingly random answer theres no way of knowing whether the key was present in the original dataset or not the theoretically minimal amount of space needed to store the values is n  r we have n rbit values after all we use the term overhead to refer to how much extra amount of data we need the bumped ribbon retrieval will often have less than 1 overhead  usage zini is intended to be used as a library but also ships the commandline tools zinipthash and ziniribbon as the

in zighttpsziglangorg the authenticator part requires zero dynamic allocations  we track the latest stable release of zig 0120 if you want to see an example on how the library could be used check out passkeezhttpsgithubcomr4guskeypass  qa details summaryinswhat is fido2inssummary fido2 is a protocol designed for authentication purposes it can be used as single factor eg as a replacement for password based authentication or as a second factor eg instead of otps details details summaryinsive heard the term passkey but what is thatinssummary passkey is a marketing term which is used to refer to a specific fido2 authenticator configuration a authenticator can be configured to use so called discoverable credentials also referred to as resident keys those credentials are stored somewhere on your device eg in a encrypted database devices can also be protected by some form of user verification this can be a pin or a built in user verification method like a finger print scanner passkey refers to fido2 using discoverable credentials and some form of user verification please note that this is only one interpretation of what passkey means as the term itself is nowhere defined see also passkeyss a shattered dreamhttpsfyblackhatsnetaublog20240426passkeysashattereddream details details summaryinshow does it workinssummary fido2 uses asymmetric cryptography to ensure the authenticity of the user a unique credential keypair is created for each relying party typically a web server and bound to the relying party id eg googlecom the private key stays on the authenticator and the public key is stored by the relying party when a user wants to authenticate herself the relying party sends a nonce a random byte string meant to be only used once and some other data over the client typically your web browser to the authenticator the authenticator looks up the required private key and signs the data with it the generated signature can then be verified by the relying party using the corresponding public key details details summaryinswhat is the difference between fido2 passkey and webauthninssummary you might have noticed that fido2 passkey and even webauthn are often used interchangeably by some articles and people which can be confusing especially for people new to the protocol here is a short overview  fido2 protocol consisting of two subprotocols client to authenticator protocol 2 ctap2 and web authentication webauthn  ctap2 specification that governs how a authenticator eg yubikey should behave and how a authenticator and a client eg webbrowser can communicate with each other  webauthn specification that defines how web applications can use a authenticator for authentication this includes the declaration of data structures and java script apis  passkey a authenticator with a specific configuration see above details details summaryinswhy should i use fido2inssummary fido2 has a lot of advantages compared to passwords 1 no secret information is shared ie the private key stays on the authenticator or is protected eg using key wrapping 2 each credential is bound to a relying party id eg googlecom which makes social engineering attacks like phishing websites quite difficult as long as the client verifies the relying party id properly 3 users dont have to be concerned with problems like password complexity 4 if well implemented fido2 provides a better user experience eg faster logins 5 a recent paper showed that with some adoptions fido2 is ready for a post quantum world under certain conditions fido2 ctap 21 and webauthn 2 provable security and postquantum instantiation cryptology eprint archive paper 20221029httpseprintiacrorg20221029pdf details details summaryinsare there problems with fido2inssummary yes there are 1 the two fido2 subprotocols ctap2 and webauthn are way more difficult to implement compared to password authentication 2 there are more points of failure because you have three parties that are involved in the authentication process authenticator client relying party 3 currently not all browsers support the ctap2 protocol well especially on linux 4 there is no way to verify that a client is trustworthy  rogue clients may communicate with a authenticator without your consent  clients may display wrong information 5 the 4th layer introduced for android ios and windows to connect authenticators and clients internally could be used as a man in the middle details details summaryinsdoes this library work with all browsersinssummary answering this question isnt straightforward the library by its nature is designed to be independent of any particular platform meaning that you have the responsibility of supplying it with data for processing to put it differently youre in charge of creating a functional interface for communicating with a client typically a web browser on linux we offer a wrapper for the uhid interface simplifying the process of presenting an application as a

that what they have serves their needs just fine but a library like this is a dependency by definition and i didnt mind adding a couple more let me show you its features  installation the best way to use ohsnap is to install it using the zig build systemhttpsziglangorglearnbuildsystem from your project repo root use zig fetch like this sh zig fetch save httpsgithubcommnemnionohsnaparchiverefstagsv031targz  then add it to your test artifact like so zig if blazydependencyohsnap  target  target optimize  optimize  ohsnapdep  libunittestsrootmoduleaddimportohsnap ohsnapdepmoduleohsnap   that should be it now youre ready to write some snaps  using ohsnap the interface will be familiar if you read the linked blog post which really you should one difference between ohsnap and the original is that ohsnap includes prettyhttpsgithubcomtimfayzpretty a clever prettyprinter for arbitrary data structures so you dont need to write a custom format method to use ohsnap although if you have one you can use that instead or both belt and suspenders kinda thing writing a snap is simple to get started do something like this zig const ohsnap  importohsnap test snap something  const oh  ohsnap  you can configure pretty by using var oh and changing settings  in ohprettyoptions const snapme  somefn try ohsnapsrc   expectequalsnapme   note that the call to src has to be directly above the string and the string has to be multiline style with the double backslashes  both this zig try ohsnapsrc  etc expectequalsnapme  and this zig try ohsnap src  etc expectequalsnapme  will work just fine this test will fail because the snapshot generated by pretty wont be equal to the empty string ohsnap will diff that empty string with what it gets out of snapme and print what it got in allgreen because thats what happens when you diff an empty string against a string which isnt empty if you like what you see updating is simple change the file to the following zig const ohsnap  importohsnap test snap something  const oh  ohsnap  you can configure pretty by using var oh and changing settings  in ohprettyoptions const snapme  somefn try ohsnapsrc update  expectequalsnapme   the snaptest will see the update which must be the beginning of the string and replace it in your file with the output of the pretty printing easy if your data structure has a format method and youd prefer to use that as a basis simply use expectequalfmt instead of expectequal if down the road the snapshot doesnt compare to the expected string ohsnap will use diffzhttpsgithubcommnemniondiffztreemoreport1 a zig port of diffmatchpatchhttpsgithubcomgooglediffmatchpatch to produce a terminalcolored characterlevel diff of the expected string with the actual string making it easy to see exactly whats changed these changes are either a bug or a new feature if its the former fix it if its the latter just add update to the head of the string again and ohsnap will oblige  patternmatching snapshots this is fine and dandy if the data structure exactly as it prints will always be the same on every test run but what if thats only true of some of the data consider this example we have a struct which looks like this zig const stampedstruct  struct  message const u8 tag u64 timestamp isize pub fn initmsg const u8 tag u64 stampedstruct  return stampedstruct message  msg tag  tag timestamp  stdtimetimestamp     which we want to snapshot test like this zig test snap with timestamp  const oh  ohsnap const withstamp  stampedstructinit frobnicate the turboencabulator 31337  try ohsnap src ohsnapstampedstruct  message const u8  frobnicate the turboencabulator  tag u64  31337  timestamp isize  1721501316  expectequalwithstamp   but of course the next time we run the test the timestamp will be different so the test will fail we care about the message and the tag we care that there is a timestamp but we dont care what the timestamp is because we know it will be changing for cases like this ohsnap includes mvzrhttpsgithubcommnemnionmvzr the minimum viable zig regex library which i wrote specifically for this purpose simply replace the timestamp like so zig try ohsnap src ohsnapstampedstruct  message const u8  frobnicate the turboencabulator  tag u64  31337  timestamp isize  d  expectequalwithstamp  through the magic of diffing ohsnap will identify the part of the new string which matches d and try to match the regular expression against that part of the string since this matches the test now passes note that the regex must be in the form  the exact regex we use is n in fact the  and  are essential and are loadbearing parts of the expression this prevents partial matches as well as making the regex portions of a snapshot test easier for ohsnap to find note that because this is a multiline string you dont have to do doublebackslashes its d not d to be very

scope the library provides a simple and thin api supporting only basic types this design choice is intentional as it is often difficult to determine the ideal mapping for more complex types the library allows users to hook into the mapping process or use the napi directly for finer control specifically there is no support for classes  structstuples value types when returning a structtuple by value it is mapped to an anonymous javascript objectarray with all propertieselements mapped recursively similarly when accepting a structtuple by value it is mapped back from javascript to the respective native type in both cases a copy is created so changes to the js object are not reflected in the native part and vice versa  struct pointers t when returning a pointer to a struct an empty javascript object will be created with the pointer wrapped inside if this javascript object is passed to a function that accepts a pointer the pointer is unwrapped back the same javascript object is obtained for the same pointer unless it has already been collected this is useful for attaching state to the javascript counterpart and accessing that data later changes to javascript objects are not reflected in the native part but getterssetters can be provided in javascript and native functions can be called as necessary  functions javascript functions can be created with ctxcreatefunctionzigfn

building a comprehensive and generic zigbased set that goes above and beyond the original go implementation after using zig for over 25 years on personal projects i thought it was time that zig had a robust set implementation for itself this implementation gives credit and acknowledgement to the zig languagehttpsziglangorg and powerful std libraryhttpsziglangorgdocumentationmasterstdstd

example zig const zjb  importzjb export fn main void  zjbglobalconsolecalllog zjbconststringhello from zig void   is equivalent to this javascript javascript consoleloghello from zig   project status zjb is fully functional and is ready to be used in other projects however 10 will not be tagged until there is significant enough usage that confidence in the api not needing further changes is high  why calling javascript functions from zig is a pain wasm has restrictions on the function api surface and how references to the runtime environment javascript can be stored so to access javascript functionality from zig you must create a function in zig which is friendly to call a function export and a function in javascript which translates into the call you actually want this isnt too bad so far but the javascript api surface is large has a lot of variadic functions and accepts many types the result is that your programming loop of just wanting to write code slows down writing a large amount of ill fitting boilerplate whenever you must cross the zig to javascript boundary this package is clearly inspired by gos solution to this problem httpspkggodevsyscalljs however there are a few significant deviations to note if youre familiar with that library 1 every call from gos package involves string decoding garbage creation and reflection calls 2 go has a one size fits all javascript file while zjb uses a generator to produce javascript for the calls you use 3 gos garbage collection and finalizers allows for automatically cleaning up references from go to javascript while zjb requires manual handle releasing 4 zig has no runtime so theres none of gos weirdness about blocking on the main thread  usage as of may 2024 zjb requires zig 0120 or greater the simple folder provides a good template to start from youll need to update to reference to zjb in buildzigzon theres currently no release schedule for point releases so you should use the latest available code eg copy the entire simple folder into your empty project then run zig fetch savezjb httpsgithubcomscottredigzigjavascriptbridgearchiveput hash of latest commit to main herezip call into javascript using zjb generate the javascript side code and then build an html page to combine them  example an example which demonstrates usage of all of the components of zjb is in the example folder it includes  srcmainzig has usage examples for the zjb zig import  buildzigs example for how to set up your build file  static includes html and javascript files to run the example to view the example in action run zig build example from inside the example folder then host a webserver from zigoutbin  details zjb functions which return a value from javascript require specifying which type is returned as arguments or return types to be passed into javascript zjb supports  i32 i64 f32 f64 these are the only numerical types that are supported by the webassembly javascript interface so you must cast to one of these before passing  comptimeint comptimefloat these are valid as arguments and are passed as f64 to javascript which is javascripts main number type  zjbhandle the zig side type for referring to javascript values most of the time this will be a javascript object of some kind but in some rare cases it might be something else such as null a number nan or undefined used as an argument it is automatically converted into the value that is held in zjbs javascript handles map when used as a return value it is automatically added to zjbs javascript handles map it is the callers responsibility to call release to remove it from the handles map when youre done using it  zjbconsthandle as arguments but not return types these values are returned by zjbconststring zjbglobal and zjbfnhandle zjbconsthandle works similarly to zjbhandle with a few notable exceptions 1 values are memoized upon first use on the zig side so they can be used any number of times without churning garbage 2 there is no release function these values are intended to be around for the lifetime of your program with reduced friction of using them as the functions which produce consthandle values all take only comptime arguments these cannot balloon uncontrolably at runtime some values are always defined as handles zjbconsthandlenull is javascripts null zjbconsthandleglobal is the global scope and zjbconsthandleemptystring is a javascript empty string  void is a valid type for method calls which have no return value zjb supports multiple ways to expose zig functions to javascript  zjbexportfn exposes the function with the passed name to javascript this supports zjbhandle so if you pass an object from a javascript function a handle will automatically be created and passed into zig it is the responsibility of the zig function being called to call release on any handles in its arguments at the appropriate time to avoid memory leaks  zjbfnhandle uses zjbexportfn and additionally returns a zjbconsthandle to that function this can be used as a callback argument in javascript functions  zigs export keyword on functions works as it always does in wasm but doesnt support zjbhandle correctly simple zig global variables can also be exposed to javascript  zjbexportglobal exposes the variable with the passed address to javascript this supports bool i32 i64 u32 u64 f32 and f64 property descriptors will be created with getset methods that provide access to the variable a few extra notes zjbstringconst u8 decodes the slice of memory as a utf8 string returning a handle the string will not update to reflect changes in the slice in zig zjbglobal will be set to the value of that global variable the first time it is called as it is intended to be used for javascript objects or classes defined in the global scope that usage will be safe for example console document or map if you use it to retrieve a value or object youve defined in javascript ensure its defined before your program runs and doesnt change the arrayview functions i8arrayview u8arrayview etc create the respective javascript typed array backed by the same memory as the zig wasm instance dataview is similar in functionality to the arrayview functions but returns a dataview object accepts any pointer or slice the generated javascript also includes a shortcut function named dataview to get an uptodate cached

summaryinswhat is this project aboutinssummary fido2 stands as a dedicated authentication protocol crafted for diverse authentication needs whether employed as a standalone method supplanting traditional passwordbased authentication or as an additional layer of security fido2 serves both purposes the fido alliance has actively advocated for the widespread adoption of this protocol for several years with 2023 witnessing a substantial surge in its adoption however its crucial to note that fido2 introduces a heightened level of complexity in comparison to conventional passwords notably the use of roaming authenticators such as yubikey can be a costintensive aspect upon initiating the keylib project in october 2022 my primary objective was to develop a library empowering individuals to transform their own hardware such as esp32 into a functional authenticator i believe ive achieved this goal successfully however during this process i also recognized the evolving trend favoring hybridplatform authenticators with discoverable credentials now commonly marketed as passkeys while traditional authenticators like yubikeys provide robust protection against various attacks they come with notable drawbacks their high cost limited updatepatching capabilities and restricted storage for discoverable credentials for instance my yubikey 5 supports around 25 credentials underscore these challenges additionally the inability to back up data although enhancing confidentiality poses availability concerns the official solution offered for this predicament is surprisingly simple buy a second one conversely platform authenticators present a more flexible and costeffective alternative unlike traditional counterparts they can undergo regular updates and patches akin to any software component furthermore these authenticators permit the backup and secure sharing of credentials leveraging an encrypted database within this project one key advantage lies in their costeffectiveness eliminating the need for additional hardware when implemented with precision platform authenticators can attain a commendable level of security providing a compelling alternative to their more expensive counterparts the primary objective of this project is to furnish an alternative keeping in mind that the term alternative is subjective and due to resource constraints i may not

send an object to task b task a must send the object to the mailbox and task b must visit the mailbox where if an object isnt there it has the option of waiting for any desired length of time  irmx 86

more functions starting with transform marble will execute all combinations of the transformation functions after every combination execute is called followed by check transformations should change the value property  marble will remember what it was originally the transformations must be such that check succeeds that is the relations between the inital output and the transformed output must still hold  checking if relations still hold you must provide a check function to see if one or more relations hold and return true if so if false is returned the test fails with a printout of the current transformationcombination relation checks may be conditional check out the tests for examples on how this works  executing you must provide an execute function that computes a result based on the current value the simplest form will simply return the current value but you can do any arbitrary operation here this function is called before any transformations to form a baseline this baseline is passed as the first argument to check  optional beforeafter calls before and after the test and every combination before and after is called if present this is useful to reset state initialize test

httpsgithubcomhazeetch also  httpsgithubcomkristoffitziggy  static site generator that has some interesting templating possibilities  zig templates made simple zts ztshttpsgithubcomzigster64ztsblobmaindocsztsjpgrawtrue zts is a minimalist zig module that helps you use text templates in a way that is simple maintainable and efficient simple  uses zig like field tags in your template  uses zig fmtprint for formatting data  no funky new templating syntax no dsl no new formatting conventions to learn  outputs to zig writer interface use it in web server apps  maintainable  control of the template logic is done in your zig code not delegated to the template engine  data passed through the template must be explicitly defined  there is no magic expansion of data structs that works fine today and breaks tomorrow as your data model evolves  mismatches between your code your data and the template are caught at compile time not runtime efficient  all template parsing is performed at comptime no runtime overhead  minimal codebase  there is just less going on compared to fullfeatured templating engines lets have a look   zts  very basic example lets say you have a template file foobartxt that looks like this   foo i prefer daytime bar i like the nighttime  note the sections foo and bar zts uses a zig like field syntax for defining the section breaks in the text then in your zig code just embed that file and then use the ztsstemplate sectionname function to return the appropriate section out of the data zig const zts  importzts const out  stdiogetstdoutwriter const tmpl  embedfilefoobartxt try outprintfoo says  sn ztsstmpl foo try outprintbar says  sn ztsstmpl bar  produces the output  foo says  i prefer daytime bar says  i like the nighttime  thats really all there is to it its basically splitting the input into sections delimited by named tags in the input text  the contents of data sections are comptime known the data returned from stemplate sectionname is comptime known  which means that it can in turn be passed to zig standard print functions as a formatting string  foo i like s bar i prefer s  zig const tmpl  embedfilefoobartxt try outprintztsstmpl foo daytime try outprintztsstmpl bar nighttime   zts print helper functions use of the stmpl sectionname function is provided as a lowlevel utility putting ztsstmpl sectionname everywhere is a bit verbose and gets a bit messy very quickly zts provides helper functions that make it easier to print ztsprinttmpl sectionname args writer works like print in zig ztswritetmpl sectionname writer works like write in zig  foo i like s bar i prefer s  zig const tmpl  embedfilefoobartxt try ztsprinttmpl foo daytime out try ztsprinttmpl bar nighttime out  because everything is happening at comptime if your template file and your zig code get out of sync due to ongoing changes nothing to fear  zig will pick that up at compile time and throw an error about missing sections in your templates as well as the standard compile errors about parameters not matching the expected fields in the template for example if you add this to the code above  zig try ztsprinttmpl other  out  this will throw a compile error saying that there is no section labelled other in the template if the template gets modified  say change the label foo to fooz in the text file  then that will also cause a compile error in the zig code saying that foo doesnt exist in the template anymore if the template changes again say  change the foo contents to i like d  then this will also cause a compile error in the zig code saying that the string parameter daytime does not match format d in the template there is no great magic here its just the power of zig comptime as it is actively parsing the text templates at compile time and using the built in zig print formatting which also evaluates at compile time  zts runtime  noncomptime helper functions if you want to pass data through template segments using the built in zig print functions on the writer then everything must be comptime there are no exceptions to this its just the way that zig print works if your template segments do not have print formatting do not need argument processing and are just blocks of text then you can use the write variant helper functions that zts provides zig try ztswriteheadertemplate out try ztswritetemplate section out  when using writetemplate section out  if the section is null or cannot be found in the data then write will print nothing there is also a lookup function that takes runtime  dynamic labels and returns a noncomptime string of the section  or null if not found its a runtime version of the s function that can be used with dynamic labels you can only use the return data from lookup in a noncomptime context though such as using the data in a writeall statement example zig  you can do some fancy dynamic processing here const dynamictemplatesection  ztslookuptmpl osgetenvplanet if dynamictemplatesection  null  stddebugprintsorry cannot find a section for the planet you are on return  try outwritealldynamictemplatesection  or you can do this using the write helper functions  note that if there is no planet env then nothing is printed try ztswritetmpl osgetenvplanet out  but you cant do this because print needs comptime values only and lookup is a runtime variant try outprintdynamictemplatesection customerdetails   compile error  dynamictemplatesection is not comptime known  and you cant do this either because s demands comptime params too const printabledynamicsection  ztsstmpl osgetenvplanet   compile error  unable to resovle comptime value  comptime restrictions can be a pain zts lookup writeheader and write might be able to help you out if you need to do some dynamic processing  or it might not depending on how deep a hole of meta programming you are in  a more common html templating example lets define a typical html file with template segments defined and add some places where we can print structured data that we pass through the template the html template looks like this  html div h1financial statement pageh1

sas width180 height94 a battletested tiny secure urlfriendly unique string id generator now available in pure zig  freestanding zignanoid is entirely freestanding  fast the algorithm is very fast and relies just on basic math speed will mostly depend on your choice of rng  safe it can use any random generator you want and the library has no errors to handle  short ids it uses a larger alphabet than uuid azaz09 so id length was reduced from 36 to 21 symbols and it is url friendly  battle tested original implementation has over 18 million weekly downloads on npmhttpswwwnpmjscompackagenanoid  portable nano id was ported to 20 programming languageshttpsgithubcomainanoidotherprogramminglanguages  example basic usage with stdcryptorandom zig const std  importstd const nanoid  importnanoid pub fn main void  const result  nanoidgeneratestdcryptorandom stdloginfonanoid s result    comparison to uuid nano id is quite comparable to uuid v4 randombased it has a similar number of random bits in the id 126 in nano id and 122 in uuid so it has a similar collision probability it also uses a bigger alphabet so a similar number of random bits are packed in just 21 symbols instead of 36 for there to be a one in a billion chance of duplication 103 trillion version 4 ids must be generated  how to use  generating an id with the default size the simplest way to generate an id with the default alphabet and length is by using the function generate like so zig const result  nanoidgeneratestdcryptorandom  if you want a custom alphabet you can use generatewithalphabet and pass either a custom alphabet or one from nanoidalphabets zig const result  nanoidgeneratewithalphabetstdcryptorandom nanoidalphabetsnumbers  this id will only contain numbers  you can find a variety of other useful alphabets inside of nanoidalphabets the result is an array of size defaultidlen which happens to be 21 which is returned by value there are no errors to handle assuming your rng object is valid everything will work the default alphabet includes the symbols  numbers and english lowercase and uppercase letters  generating an id with a custom size if you want a custom alphabet and length use generateex or generateexwithiterativerng the function generateex takes an rng an alphabet a resultbuffer that it will write the id to and a stepbuffer the stepbuffer is used by the algorithm to store a random bytes so it has to do less calls to the rng and stepbufferlen must be at least computerngstepbufferlengthcomputemasktruncateu8 alphabetlen resultbufferlen alphabetlen the function generateexwithiterativerng is the same as generateex except it doesnt need a stepbuffer it will use randomintu8 instead of randombytes to get a random byte at a time thus avoiding the need for a rng step buffer normally this will be slower but depending on your rng algorithm or other requirements it might not be so the option is there in case you need but normally it is recommended you use generateex which requires a temporary buffer that will be filled using randombytes in order to get the best performance additionally you can precompute a sufficient length for the stepbuffer and preallocate it as an optimization using computesufficientrngstepbufferlengthfor which simply asks for the largest possible id length you want to generate if you intend to use the defaultidlen you can use the constant nanoidrngstepbufferlensufficientfordefaultlengthids  regarding rngs you will need to provide an random number generator rng yourself you can use the zig standard library ones either stdranddefaultprng or if you have stricter security requirements use stdranddefaultcsprng or stdcryptorandom when you initialize them you need to provide a seed providing the same one every time will result in the same ids being generated every time you run the program except for stdcryptorandom if you want a good secure seed you can generate one using stdcryptorandombytes here is an example of how you would initialize and seed stdranddefaultcsprng and use it zig  generate seed var seed stdranddefaultcsprngsecretseedlengthu8  undefined stdcryptorandombytesseed  initialize the rng and

to link against msvcrt etc if you want to avoid that you can target windowsgnu this is the default behavior of buildcrab but that has its own problems since both rust and zig provide compilerrtlib with most of the symbols having weak linking but not chkstk and chkstkms so if you want to link against a rust library that needs these intrinsics you should somehow resolve the conflict though im not

failure case and a message is displayed to the user 2 if there is a default value on the field of the struct and a vale is not passed for that field it is treated as an optional case and will use the static value ie no error message and value is set 3 simple structs only for now no recursive struct fields at the moment ie no embeded structs 4 if the users passed the wrong type which differes from

with a max size that allocates directly from virtual memory memory is only committed when actually used and virtual page table mappings are relatively cheap so you only pay for the memory that youre actually using additionally since all memory remains inplace and new memory is committed incrementally at the end of the array there are no additional recopies of data made when the array is enlarged ideal use cases are for large arrays that potentially grow over time when reallocating a dynamic array with a high upper bound would be a waste of memory and depending on dynamic resizing may incur high recopy costs due to the size of the array consider using this array type another good use case is when stable pointers or slices to the array contents are desired since the memory is never moved pointers to the contents of the array will not be invalidated when growing not recommended for small arrays since the minimum allocation size is the platforms minimum page size also not for use with platforms that dont support virtual memory such as wasm typical usage is to specify a large size upfront that the array should not encounter such as 2gb then use the array as usual if freeing memory is desired shrinkandfree will decommit memory at the end of the array total memory usage can be calculated with calctotalusedbytes the interface is very similar to arraylist except for the allocator

reverses the order in which players take turns  team play  allow multiple users to collab as a team  exotic victory conditions  not just lines but other shapes to allow victory  whats interesting from a code point of view  this code is interesting and worth a read for the following reasons   its all written in zig httpziglangorg fast  safe  easy to read  pick all 3  it uses the excellent httpzig library httpsgithubcomkarlseguinhttpzig to do all the web stuff i have had exactly zero issues using this lib  single file binary which includes the game a web server all assets such as html images and audio 1 file  no litter on your filesystem  generated docker image  770kb compressed all it has is the compiled executable 25mb which includes only a single binary nothing else  run stats  in releasefast mode running a 2 player game uses less than 2mb ram to run and hardly any cpu its pretty resource efficient  its about as simple as doing the same thing in go there is really nothing too nasty required in the code  the router and all the html contents is part of the game object  the implications of this are that it is possible to create web components using this zightmx approach that are all self contained and can be imported into other projects without having to know about connecting up routes or pulling in content interesting  uses sse  event streams to keep it all realtime with pubsub updates for multiple players is simple and it works and requires only a trivial amount of code to do  demonstrates how to do threading thread conditions  signalling and using mutexes to make object updates thread safe its a bit tricky to do cleanly still but i guess that concurrency was never meant to be easy its certainly no harder than doing the some concurrency in go  no websockets needed  there is pretty much no javascript on the frontend it uses htmx httpshtmxorg  which is an alternative approach to web clients where the frontend is pure hypertext and everything is done on the backend  there is a tiny bit of js to play some audio and to update the session id but im still thinking up a way of getting rid of that as well  uses stdfmtprint as the templating engine i didnt know before but you can use named tags inside the comptime format string and use those to reference fields in the args param actually makes for a half decent templating tool without having to find and import a templating lib ie  responseprinti can use names and addresss in a fmtprint statement and it references fields from the struct passed   name  johnny ziggy address  22 zig street zigville 90210   thats pretty good  dont really need a templating engine to do most things like that then can just use stdfmtprint in fact this is better than using a template engine because you can store the html in actual html files  which means your editor goes into full html mode otherwise need to come up with yet another jsx like thing and then write a bunch of editor tooling to understand it yuk  keep it simple i reckon just use stdfmt and just use html files not sure if its worth adding a templating lib  at least to do loops and some basic flow control because its often much much better to take the full power of a real language instead and just emit formatted fragments go has a pretty comprehensive and well done text templating tool in the stdlib but its quite a pain to use and impossible to debug when thing do go wrong compared to doing the hard stuff in a real language  htmx thoughts yeah its pretty cool worth adding to your toolbelt not sure its really a replacement for spa type apps  i think it might be painful for larger apps not sure havnt tried yet what it is 100 excellent for though is for doing apps where there is a lot of shared state between users like a turn based game  in that case doing everything on the server and not having any state at all on the frontend to sync is really ideal its a good fit to this sort of problem its super robust you can do horrible things like reboot the backend or hard refresh the front ends  and it maintains state without a hiccup and without needing any exception handling code at all very nice it would be a nightmare doing this in react there are some very complex things you could do with a turnbasedmultiplayergame type of model though doesnt have to be a game even and being able to do that","nektro/zig-ansi":"ansi utilities for cli

benchmarking options are determined  test integration the simplest way to define and run benchmarks is utilising the zig test system zubench will use a custom test runner to run the benchmarks this means that benchmarks are simply zig tests ie test   code to benchmark  in order to avoid benchmarking regular tests when using this system you should consider the way that zig analyses test declarations and either give the names of benchmark tests a unique substring that can be used as a test filter or organise your tests so that when the compiller analyses the root file for benchmark

zig  add to srcfilezig  the zubench package const bench  importsrcbenchzig pub const benchmarks   benchmark func1  benchspecfunc1 args   arg1 arg2  maxsamples  100  benchmark func2  benchspecfunc2 args   arg1 arg2 arg3  maxsamples  1000 opts   outlierdetection  none   disable outlier detection   the above snippet would cause two benchmarks to be run called benchmark func1 and benchmark func2 for functions func1 and func2 respectively the args field of a spec is a stdmetaargstuple for the corresponding function and maxsamples determines the maximum number of times the function is run during benchmarking a complete example can be found in examplesfibbuildzig it is also relatively straightforward to write a standalone executable to perform benchmarks without using the build system integration to create a benchmark for a function func run it measuring process and wall time and obtain a report all that is needed is zig var progress  stdprogressstart var bm  try benchmarkfuncinitallocator benchmark name  funcarg1    maxsamples progress const report  bmrun bmdeinit  the report then holds a statistical summary of the benchmark and can used with stdiowriterprint for terminalstyle readable output or stdjsonstringify for json output see examples for complete examples  custom exectuable it is also possible to write a custom benchmarking executable using zubench

zig build as you normally do things i like 1 hey it works at least it looks like it does and since nothing like this exists in the standard library i consider it a success 2 you can throw your struct and an ast at a function pub fn zontostruct and have your struct filled with data the fields that have matching values in the provided ast that is and you get to know what was filled and what was not  look and the returned struct 3 or you can fetch the values of the fields you need using string paths to indicate them calling pub fn getfieldval its fine if all you need is a couple of fields 3 all the basics are covered  signed and unsigned integers and floats strings single characters booleans nested structs arrays arrays of arrays arrays of structs in fact any combination of structs and arrays should work things i dont really like 1 no ast validity verification thinking about zon schemas or similar in the future maybe 2 if you use the second approach pub fn getfieldval for every field you want to read youve got to specify the path the path is split the ast is walked and if you have rather large structures to fetch a lot of this work is repeated for each field not the best approach performancewise but you can switch to pub fn zontostruct which fills all the fields it can it one go 3 an ugly hack that i had to use in order to get negative values from the fields both integers and floating point see fn fullltokenslice i cant be sure my approach works correctly in all situations or will continue to work in the future so i feel really uneasy about using it for

iterator means that the types enumrating all element of a set of values  support this library is developped with  debian x8664 104  zig 0100 and zigmod r80  zig 091 and zigmod r79  build sh zig build   unit test to performs unit tests of iterzig sh zig build test   example an example program using iterzig is provided the program can be performed with sh zig build example  source code of this program is srcmainzig  generate docs to generate documentations sh zig build doc  a html documents would be generated under the docs directory  iterator concept iterator is a generic concept that objects that enumrating a set of values especially in this library iterator is a value of a kind of types that satisfies follow constraints the constraints are  have self type  have item type  have next method takes self and returns item where the self type specifies the type itself equals to this the item type represents the type of elements returns from the iterator and the next method returns a next value of the container if the next value is not exists null must be returned the order of occurence of values are implementation defined however all values must occur exactly once before null is returned  features  meta function the type constraints required as an iteratoriteratorconcept is able to be checked by isiterator function statically zig comptime assertisiteratorsliceiteru32 comptime assertisiteratoru32  when you implement a new type to be an iterator it must ensure that isiterator returns true  container iterators iterzig provides several basic iterators that wraps standard containers  arrayiter  sliceiter  arraylistiter  singlylinkedlistiter  boundedarrayiter  tailqueueiter for example an iterator on a slice is able to be used as follows zig var arr  u32 1 2 3  var iter  sliceiteru32newarr0 try expectequalasu32 1 iternext try expectequalasu32 2 iternext try expectequalasu32 3 iternext try expectequalasu32 null iternext  further const variations are defined for each containers these iterators behaves as same to nonconst variations except for returns const pointers  arrayconstiter  sliceconstiter  arraylistconstiter  singlylinkedlistconstiter  boundedarrayconstiter  tailqueueconstiter zig var arr  u32 1 2 3  var iter  sliceconstiteru32newarr0 iternext  1  error cannot assign to constant  note that these iterators not own container values into it the user must release the memory holding the container if necessary  iterators to containers iterator to container converters are defined for some std containers  slicefromiter  arraylistfromiter  boundedarrayfromiter  singlylinkedlistfromiter these converters consume the input iterator and build a container the constructed container contains all the elements of the iterator and no other elements  range iterator range creates a range value such that it represents a range of numbers for example range0 10 means that the numbers from 0 to 10 which is mathematics is denoted as 010 in particular range instantiated with integral type to be iterator zig var rng  rangeasu32 0 3 try expectequalasu32 0 rngnext try expectequalasu32 1 rngnext try expectequalasu32 2 rngnext try expectequalasu32 null rngnext  similarly rangefrom creates an instance of rangefrom to represents an endless sequence of numbers eg rangefromasu32 0 creates an endless sequence of natural numbers 012 zig var rng  rangefromasu32 0 try expectequalasu32 0 rngnext try expectequalasu32 1 rngnext try expectequalasu32 2 rngnext   when range or rangefrom is instantiated with a type of floating numbers it would not be an iterator it is just a range of values zig comptime assertconceptisiteratorrangerangef64 comptime assertconceptisiteratorrangerangefromf64 comptime assert rangerangeasf64 20

library offers a compact data structure for generalized1 utf8 encoded codepoints the design is based on an implicit data structurehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiimplicitdatastructure2 which uses popcount and bit masking to check membership quickly with minimal branching and without having to decode the utf8 into another format for instance a codepoint this design is original in the sense that i invented it there may be prior art its remarkably difficult to search for utf8 character sets and find papers on set data structures so i cant say with high confidence that its truly novel in a sense its an obvious extension of the widespread practice of using a pair of u64 bitmasks to detect a set of ascii values what i can say is its effective the runeset struct is just a slice of u64 offering a few variations on set membership tests depending on how confident you are that the string its testing is valid utf8 and what you would like the test to do in the event that it isnt also supported are the fundamental set operations equality subset union intersection and difference all of the three combining forms produce a new runeset and must be given an allocator the runeset is immutable by design and as such doesnt support adding or removing codepoints to an alreadycreated set this would be possible to implement in principle but i dont happen to have a use for mutable adds and removes and therefore didnt write them you can create a runeset containing a single character and via union or difference either add or subtract that character if you would like this would create a new runeset with just that character added or removed the data structure is very fast the test suite with extensions contains 5mb of sample data with a 20mb extra collection and performs a multitude of operations on that data on the order of a dozen per string in releasefast mode the main suite of 5mb concludes in roughly a second on an m1 with the annex including fuzzing the creation function 224 times a complete run is over in six seconds give or take a few milli about 23rds of that is the fuzzing while i have yet to set up definitive benchmarks its clear that membership testing using runeset has a throughput over 100 mbsec on modern machines potentially substantially higher than this ill update this with better numbers when i get around to benchmarking it the focus has been on implementing the library and assuring good test coverage for real character sets it is also quite sparing of memory the cjk ideographs block of unicode consisting of 22992 codepoints is represented as a runeset in 338 words dense ranges such as that block can of course be tested by decoding the tested sequence into a codepoint and checking if its in that range but the combination of generality compactness and speed offered by the runeset is unique speaking of test coverage the library has 100 line coverage which you may verify by running zig build cov provided you have kcovhttpsgithubcomsimonkagstromkcov installed to run the extended suite including the fuzzer use zig build dtestmore test this will take an appreciable amount of time in the default debugmode builds as it will trigger the 244 assertions which gird the library  roadmap i intend to add some ability to write out the data structure whether as binary data zig source code or potentially both as an allocating data structure it isnt currently possible to generate a runeset at comptime and many applications of them will use character sets known in advance which may as well be built into the rodata of programs rather than constructed at runtime from strings i also plan to wrap all of the major functionality in ccompatible data structures and functions for use wherever the c abi is spoken other than that i consider the library fully implemented and featurecomplete odds are good however that more opensource code which makes use of the runeset as a foundation will be forthcoming 1 generalized here has a similar meaning to its use in wtf8httpssimonsapingithubiowtf8 except that runeset can also encode socalled overlong encodings as well as surrogates paired vs unpaired is a meaningless distinction for a codepoint set this falls out of the design its capable of encoding those sequences and i saw no reason to impose a performance burden in order to prevent it on the contrary should you want to represent the set of all overlong encodings perhaps to detect them and raise an error a runeset is a fine way to do it a set which does not contain overlong encodings or surrogates will never match against them so this seeming laxity comes with no disadvantages the five and sixbyte sequences from pike and thompsons original fss utf8 of 1993 are not supported as such what would constitute lead bytes for those sequences are rejected as invalid it would be possible to extend the runeset data structure to include these if there were ever any point in so doing 2 that the runeset is implicit doesnt make it the smallest possible encoding for every subset of utf8 for example the cjk unified ideographs block could be represented as two numbers and for some crafted inputs such as one in 64 characters throughout the unicode range a bitmask of one bit per character would be smaller as well it means that the structure is implicit to the data without indirection and that in full generality it isnt possible to represent utf8 sequences more compactly compared to the information theoretic lowerbound our overhead is limited to one word used to store one of the offsets as an important

executables why not just use embedfile  embed stitch serves a different purpose namely to let build systems and users of your software create selfcontained executables for example instead of requiring users to install an interpreter and execute mylisp fiblisp they can simply run fib or fibexe resoures can be anything such as scripts images text templates config files and other executables  some use cases  self extracting tools like an installer  create executables for scripts written in your interpreted programming language  include a sample config file which is extracted on first run the user can then edit this  an image in your own format thats able to display itself when executed  building the project to build with zig 013 use the zigversion tagrelease to build with zig master use the main branch last tested with zig 0140dev130cb308ba3a zig build will put a bin and lib directory in your output folder eg zigout  binstitch is a standalone tool for attaching resources to executables this can also be done programmatically using the library  liblibstitch is a library for reading attached resources from the current executable and for adding resources to executables like the standalone tool  using the tool this example adds two scripts to a lisp interpreter that supports through the stitch library reading embedded scripts bash stitch mylisp stdlisp fiblisp output fib fib 8 21  resources can be named explicitly bash stitch mylisp stdstdlisp fibonaccifiblisp output fib  if a name is not given the filename without path is used the stitch library supports finding resources by name or index the output flag is optional by default resources are added to the original executable first argument  stitching programmatically lets say you want your interpreted programming language to support producing binaries an easy way to do this is to create an interpreter executable that reads scripts attached to itself using stitch you can provide interpreter binaries for all the oses you wanna support or have the zig build file do this if your user is building the interpreter in the example below a lisp interpreter uses the stitch library to support creating selfcontained executables bash mylisp createexe sqlclientlisp output sqlclient  the resulting binary can now be executed  sqlclient  you can make the mylisp binary understand stitch attachments and then make a copy of it and stitch it with the scripts alternatively you can have separate interpreter binaries specifically for reading stitched scripts  using the library from c include the stitchh

given a collection of tiles and associated adjacency constraints as well a tile generator for implementing the overlapping mode see the original implementationhttpsgithubcommxgmnwavefunctioncollapse

that field out initially this make zig report the correct hash value  wfc core wfc is sometimes considered as having two different modes overlapping and tiled i think is description is a little misleading i would rather say the wfc is a tiling generator or maybe even more generally a graph colouring algorithm and the overlapping mode merely one of several processing pipelines that can be used to achieve various effects a good explanation how the core tiling algorithm relates to the overlapping mode can be found herehttpswwwgridbugsorgwavefunctioncollapse another processing pipeline of particular interest i havent yet seen talked about is what could be called the iterative mode if we want to keep the nomenclature of modes which allows for generating largescale structurelargescalestructure which are usually considered outside the scope of wfc the most common situation is generating a 2d or 3d cubic tiling and this library is currently restricted to 2dimensional rectangular tilings  features and todos  x generic core algorithm you can use with any set of 2d tilesedge constraints forming a rectangular grid  x generate tiles from image overlapping mode  x seeded generation  generation constraints  x maximum tile count ie max number of times a tile can be used    minimum tile count ie min number of times a tile can be used    connectivity constraints ie forces tiles to be part of the same regionpath    distance constraints distance between particular tiles and of paths    tile symmetry groups    iterative pipeline    ndimensional rectangular tilings    hexagonal grid  iterative pipeline helper utilities for the iterative pipeline is not yet implemented but are planned for the future this pipeline is a fairly general idea that produces intermediate tilings that are used to seed the next stage  largescale structure wfc does not generally produce largescale structures as the constraints it considers are all local however the core tiling algorithm can be used to generate largescale structure fairly easily using an iterative strategy the basic idea is to first generate a low resolution tiling which is used to seed subsequent tile generation the increase in resolution naturally leads to the initial tiling producing largescale structure for example say you wanted to generate a 2d tiling with some largerscale structure that includes houses roads and grass including more specialised tiles for the boundary regions between the road and a front lawn like a footpath you could start by generating a seed tiling at a lower resolution that has the tiles property and road you then expand this tiling into a higher resolution one initially seeded with house footpath and grass tiles in the regions associated to property tiles and road tiles seeded where the road tiles were the adjacency constraints for footpath can then require that they border road tiles and grass tiles surround house tiles this guarantees

other languages we welcome you you might be asking the questions like how can i transform this zig collection how can i filter out elements and other perfectly valid questions based on what you might be used to from where you are coming from the answer in zig is it depends but youll likely be using a for loop and allocating a copy of the collection you have on hand lets use a very simple example doubling the value of an array of elems that you may do something later with ill just print it out for simplicity but youll likely be doing something more useful zig const elems  i32 1 2 3    conjure an allocator for the list below var gpa  stdheapgeneralpurposeallocator defer   gpadeinit const allocator  gpaallocator   allocate a new list to hold the data of the transformation dont forget to deallocate it var buf  try stdarraylisti32initcapacityallocator elemslen defer bufdeinit for elems elem  bufappendassumecapacityelem  2    capture a ref to the slice of data you want dont forget to deallocate it const doubled  try buftoownedslice defer allocatorfreedoubled   do something with it for doubled elem  stddebugprintd elem   the simple example above quickly becomes much more complicated as additional transformations and filtering is required if you are coming to zig from another language you are probably used to expressing this with something like elemsmap with this library you can almost have that too below is an equivalent program but sans required additional allocations and zigs required memory deallocation zig var elems  i32  1 2 3    create an interator and apply a transformation var doubled  iterfromelems thenmapi32 struct  fn funcn i32 i32  return n  2  func   do something with it while doublednext elem  stddebugprintd elem   i say almost because  zig does not support closures but it does support functions as arguments so we can emulate these to a certain degree with struct fn references  some changes to usingnamespacehttpsgithubcomsoftpropszigiterissues1 facilitate the need for an itermediatory method we use then to access and chain iterator methods if zig brings that back in a different form this

treat the latter as any other error in the event that zig adds a todo error to the test system ztap will support that also the ztappanic function will add a comment to the tap output naming the test

embedded ssl libraryhttpswwwwolfsslcomproductswolfssl formerly cyassl is a lightweight ssltls library written in ansi c and targeted for embedded rtos and resourceconstrained environments  primarily because of its small size speed and feature set it is commonly used in standard operating environments as well because of its royaltyfree pricing and excellent cross platform support wolfssl supports industry standards up to the current tls 13httpswwwwolfsslcomtls13 and dtls 13 is up to 20 times smaller than openssl and offers progressive ciphers such as chacha20 curve25519 blake2b and postquantum tls 13 groups user benchmarking and feedback reports dramatically better performance when using wolfssl over openssl wolfssl is powered by the wolfcrypt cryptography library two versions of wolfcrypt have been fips 1402 validated certificate 2425 and certificate 3389 fips 1403 validation is in progress for additional information visit the wolfcrypt fips faqhttpswwwwolfsslcomlicensefips or contact fipswolfsslcom  why choose wolfssl there are many reasons to choose wolfssl as your embedded desktop mobile or enterprise ssltls solution some of the top reasons include size typical footprint sizes range from 20100 kb support for the newest standards ssl 30 tls 10 tls 11 tls 12 tls 13 dtls 10 dtls 12 and dtls 13 current and progressive cipher support including stream ciphers multiplatform royalty free and an openssl compatibility api to ease porting into existing applications which have previously used the openssl package for a complete feature list see chapter 4httpswwwwolfsslcomdocswolfsslmanualch4 of the wolfssl manual  notes please read  note 1 wolfssl as of 366 no longer enables sslv3 by default wolfssl also no longer supports static key cipher suites with psk rsa or ecdh this means if you plan to use tls cipher suites you must enable dh dh is on by default or enable ecc ecc is on by default or you must enable static key cipher suites with one or more of the following defines  wolfsslstaticdh wolfsslstaticrsa wolfsslstaticpsk  though static key cipher suites are deprecated and will be removed from future versions of tls they also lower your security by removing pfs when compiling sslc wolfssl will now issue a compiler error if no cipher suites are available you can remove this error by defining wolfsslallownosuites in the event that you desire that ie youre not using tls cipher suites  note 2 wolfssl takes a different approach to certificate verification than openssl does the default policy for the client is to verify the server this means that if you dont load cas to verify the server youll get a connect error no signer error to confirm failure 188 if you want to mimic openssl behavior of having sslconnect succeed even if verifying the server fails and reducing security you can do this by calling c wolfsslctxsetverifyctx wolfsslverifynone null  before calling wolfsslnew though its not recommended  note 3 the enum values sha sha256 sha384 sha512 are no longer available when wolfssl is built with enableopensslextra opensslextra or with the macro nooldshanames these names get mapped to the openssl api for a single call hash function instead the name wcsha wcsha256 wcsha384 and wcsha512 should be used for the enum name  wolfssl release 572 july 08 2024 release 572 has been developed according to wolfssls

ropeshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiropedatastructure  on each side of the gap is a string the gap of the gap buffer should be at the same location as the cursor in the text editor when the cursor moves the gap moves moving the cursor causes no allocation because it is moving data from the right side of the gap to the left side inserting text appends to the data on the left side shrinking the gap

creating your own match predicates  both bind and  use no special casing you could implement yourself  any custom matcher must be of type fn comptime type custommatcher  the impl will take in this type pass in the type it needs to bind to and collect all the needed captures  todo make like 10x more ergonomic  planned features  matching on vectors others maybe  optimize this so its not just willy nilly checking basically  exhaustive patterns hardmode  unreachable pattern errors if i feel like it  more helper match predicates such as partial ref  safety check for ensuring a match only ever matches on one branch  custom matchers a custom matcher is any function of the form fn comptime type matcher where the input is the type it is being matched against bindname and  are both custom matchers implementable you could just as easily implement for example in the pattern age  2 birth   pos    is actually a function which will take the types of thingbirth and thingpos respectively matcher is defined as such zig pub const matcher  struct  captures type trybind fn self matcher valptr anytype outptr anytype bool   captures is a struct type where each field is an output the matcher produces this is needed for features like bind all fields are combined using comptime into one giant struct that is returned from the arm trybind is where all the magic happens  self allows you to access the captures field  valptr is a pointer to the field being matched against the fields type will be the same type that was passed into the custom matcher  outptr lets you write to the out of the arm if you had any captures for example outptrhello  2 would write 2 to the hello field of the output you can only write to fields that were already declared as captures  return true if the value in valptr matches whatever criteria you want or false if not  custom array matchers these are similar to custom matchers but they only work in array or slice patterns refrestname is a custom array matcher instead of having to have a pattern for the entire length of the array you can match over part of it you can only have custom array matcher per arrayslice pattern test match arrays  const list

parameter is the child type of the array or slice and the second is the length of the array or null if it is a slice subslicematcher has a captures field similar to a custom matcher as well as a trybind fn the only difference is that instead of valptr it will take subslice if the matched against type is an array subslice will be a pointer to the subarray that is not matched against in the

breakpoint and debug a single test  stack traces of relevant code only  skips stack frames from testz itself as well as main where the test runner is called  provides a test runner utility function with argument parsing for a default use case  has a test discovery helper that searches for tests by finding public functions in a passed in module allowing tests to be skipped by prepending skip to the start of the function name testz runners are just another executable you setup in your buildzig with the library providing a number of helpers to make it as easy as possible to create tests debugging is simple since you can run your debugger just like with any normal flat executable and use the built in filtering to narrow down what test or set of tests gets run  example heres what the example project running a couple of tests in nonverbose mode looks like nonverbose outputimagesnonverboseoutputpng heres the verbose mode of output from the example project failing test example

test functions are simply any public function in a module you pass into discovertests the testz library has a number of expectxyz functions you can use to make assertions in your code if one fails testz will capture the name of the failed test error message and stack trace with contextual lines  test runner here is an example test runner program that you would create in your project it shows test discovery and using the built in test runner with standard argument parsing testsmainzig const std  importstd const testz  importtestz const discoveredtests  testzdiscovertests testzgroup name

is a light comptime wrapper around your struct that provides   an ordered hashmap collection of elements synched to disk  crud operations against that collection  a single primary key stored as extra metadata against the usersupplied struct  primary keys can be one of  serial number uuid custom string  timeseries extension to provide each record in a table with an unlimited audit trail of state transitions  timeseries handy functions to get element state at a point in time  events over a period etc  handles tagged union data so each table may store multiple variants of a type but still using a strict schema across types  handles tree structured data so you can optionally overlay a heirachy on top of your collection  utility functions for tree data to reparent nodes or move nodes up and down within their parent block the example directory contains a large number of example scenarios datastores and reports the wiki contains a structured walk through tutorial for how to use the different datastore types   types of datastore  table datatabledata for 2d tables where each row is an instance of your data struct with additional metadata to record the key etc example a table of customer information  tree datatreedata for tree structured data where each row is an instance of your data struct with additional metadata that references the parent row example a tree of projects within a heirachy of projects  timeseries datatimeseriesdata for streaming  event  state transition data where each row is an instance of your event data with additional metadata to reference the parent record and a timestamp for when the record was created example lets say we have a game with a table of monster we can add a timeseries datastore which tracks the xy location and current hitpoints of any monster at each turn in the game this keeps the original monster table unmodified and tracks an audit trail of state transitions for all monsters in a separate timeseries array   operations on a datastore  function  description  notes    load  loads the datastore from disk    save  saves the datastore to disk    items record  returns an ordered arraylist of all items in the datastore  caller owns the arraylist must free after use   appendvalue key  add an item to the datastore will compute a new primary key for the record  returns the value of the newly computed primary key for the new record   putkey value  updates the value of the record with the given key   getkey record  returns the record with the given key   deletekey  deletes the record with the given key  deleted records are kept on disk but marked as invalid   vacuum  vacuum will strip out all deleted records from the datastore and renumber the serial primary keys plus any referenced records in timeseries datastores   selectfilterfn record  returns an ordered arraylist of all the items that match the given filter the filter is a function that takes the record value and returns true if it matches  caller owns the arraylist and must free after use   migrateoldstruct newstruct  converts existing datastores from the old record structure to a new record structure    types of keys  serial tables with a serial primary key when a new record is added to a table it automatically gets assigned to number of records  1  uuid uuid primary keys generate a new random uuidv4 value when new

depends bfs and dij are both shortest path algorithms the only difference between them is that bfs gives the shortest path based on how many edges it needs to travel to reach the goal while dij considers the weights of the edges treating them like distances between vertices if all edges have the same weight then dij will give the same result as bfsd  the depthfirst group of algorithms is different and graphdependent if the graph is undirected where all vertices are randomly connected they will not necessarily produce the shortest paths from origin to destination they explore the graph as a whole and are useful for finding the longest possible paths if we have such an undirected tangly graph with 1m randomly connected vertices and if it is possible to travel from the first vertex to the last vertex and visit all the nodes the recursive dfsc algorithm will find this path from 1m  1 vertex  dfsb is the authors iterative algorithm which emulates true recursion to a large extent in some scenarios the paths it produces are identical to true recursion with an identical stack trace but may differ in branches it is only designed for undirected graphs as a dfsc replacement  dfsa is a lazy iterative algorithm often found in books and used worldwide it is an inversion of bfs where the queue is substituted for the stack in the case of an undirected randomly connected graph the paths it produces will be much shorter than those of the recursive dfsc additional parameters are  knockout a set of vertices to remove from the traversal or to traverse only  target the target of the

documentation online at httpboostorggithubiohana the documentation covers everything you should need including installing the library a tutorial explaining what hana is and how to use it and an extensive reference section with examples the remainder of this readme is mostly for people that wish to work on the library itself not for its users an offline copy of the documentation can be obtained by checking out the ghpages branch to avoid overwriting the current directory you can clone the ghpages branch into a subdirectory like dochtml shell git clone httpgithubcomboostorghana branchghpages depth1 dochtml  after issuing this dochtml will contain exactly the same static website that is available onlinehanadocs note that dochtml is automatically ignored by git so updating the documentation wont pollute your index  hacking on hana setting yourself up to work on hana is easy first you will need an installation of cmake once this is done you can cd to the root of the project and setup the build directory shell mkdir build cmake s  b build  sometimes youll want to specify a custom compiler because the systems compiler is too old shell cmake s  b build dcmakecxxcompilerpathtocompiler  usually this will work just fine however on some older systems the standard library andor compiler provided by default does not support c14 if this is your case the wikihanawiki has more information about setting you up on different systems normally hana tries to find boost headers if you have them on your system its also fine if you dont have them a few tests requiring the boost headers will be disabled in that case however if youd like hana to use a custom installation of boost you can specify the path to this custom installation shell cmake s  b build dcmakecxxcompilerpathtocompiler dboostrootpathtoboost  you can now build and run the unit tests and the examples shell cmake build build target check  you should be aware that compiling the unit tests is pretty time and ram consuming especially the tests for external adapters this is due to the fact that hanas unit tests are very thorough and also that heterogeneous sequences in other libraries tend to have horrible compiletime performance there are also optional targets which are enabled only when the required software is available on your computer for example generating the documentation requires doxygen to be installed an informative message will be printed during the cmake generation step whenever an optional target is disabled you can install any missing software and then rerun the cmake generation to update the list of available targets   tip  you can use the help target to get a list of all the available targets if you want to add unit tests or examples just add a source file in test or example and then rerun the cmake generation step so the new source file is known to the build system lets suppose the relative path from the root of the project to the new source file is pathtofilecpp when you rerun the cmake generation step a new target named pathtofile will be created and a test of the same name will also be created hence shell cmake build build target pathtofile  builds the program associated to pathtofilecpp ctest testdir build r pathtofile  runs the program as a test    tip for sublime text users  if you use the provided hanasublimeprojecthanasublimeproject file  you can select the hana build current file build system when viewing a  file to which a target is associated like a test or an example you can  then compile it by pressing b or compile and then run it using b  project organization the project is organized in a couple of subdirectories  the benchmarkbenchmark directory contains compiletime and runtime benchmarks to make sure the library is as

exceptions are float and untagged union types floats can be hashed though a convenient and fast key wrapper that breaks the float on integer and memo parts with controlled precision is present in the

tests except rg are designed to keep the map small the keys are rotated so the tests are tombstoneheavy especially the exh test at the end of the test on the default 1m ops the map has wrenched with 980k tombstones under the size of only 1 benchmark against zigs both hashmap and arrayhashmap can be called in the command line via  zig build bench  the default test runs on one million ops you can run it with any number of operations append the number as zig build bench  12345678 it is okay to format the number as 12345678 with an underscore unintentionally we can make the number too large which may not be what we want  performance and stats for each card the tests are run as four independent loops of 100 ops each until the specified cap is reached the results are interesting sure a map like eruzero which does not let deleted items accumulate will have a huge advantage over the one without such a heuristic also it seems that building a hashmap backed by an underlying arraylist is much more effective than talking directly to the allocator at least in zigs universe further discussion is needed we did this on u64 keys wyhash for both maps gpa allocator releasefast mode and apple

foreword how fast is pieq on the apple m1 cpu inserting in random order and removing 100000000 unsigned 32bit integer pairs in releasefast mode takes 15 seconds for insert and about 20 seconds for remove the cumulative time stayed within 22 seconds for many attempts which pushes pieq a bit into hashmap territory and pieq does not warp under heavy load because there are no recursive calls addremove time compared to zigs standard priorityqueue library shows that pieq is twice as fast the api is designed to be as literal and selfexplanatory as possible pieq uses an implicit data structure so there is no memory allocation routine the possible error interface is reduced to a bare minimum like warning you if the queue is empty and you still want to pull something from it that must be an error every public method has a comprehensive doc string where needed and the full api is used in the test section interesting uncommon features like changing the root or locking the root are also implemented pieq has two modes of operation minoriented and maxoriented which are turned on by passing min or max parameters during initiation this is along with the general idea of a priority queue however keys can also be complex types pieq gives you the ability to define what is min and what is max and is designed to handle any key anything you know how to compare if not invent how for example pieq can be easily used as a data filter sorting multivalued elements together such as enums literals or you can filter items with certain keys you are interested in and put them strictly in front of the queue to pop them earlier than the rest maybe you want to queue vectors as keys or functions that call other functions you can do that there could be many dozens of possible

any of your exported functions myfunc   warning the zigjs version used in your zig code and js code must match im not promising any protocol stability right now so pin your versions appropriately to determine what version is compatible look up the tagged version in this repository and the corresponding commits  internals the fundamental idea in this is based on the go syscalljshttpspkggodevsyscalljs package the implementation is relatively diverged since zig doesnt have a runtime or garbage collection but the fundamental idea of sharing refs and the format of those refs is based on gos implementation the main idea is that zig communicates to js what values it would like to request such as the global object js generates a ref for this object a unique 64bit numeric value and sends that to zig this ref now uniquely identifies the value for future calls such as give me the document property on this ref the ref itself is a 64bit value for numeric types the ref is the value we take advantage of the fact that all numbers in javascript are ieee 754 encoded 64bit floats and use nan as a way to send nonnumeric values to zig nanboxing nan in ieee 754 encoding is 011111111111anything but all 0s in binary we use a common nan value of 01111111111110000000 so that we can use the bottom leastsignificant 49 bits to store type information and a 32bit id the 32bit id is just an index into an array on the js side a simple scheme is used to reuse ids after theyre dereferenced  performance usage of this package causes the wasmjs boundary to be crossed a lot and this is generally not very fast and not an optimal way to use wasm the optimal way to use wasm is more like a gpu have the host or wasm module preload a bunch of work into a byte buffer and send it over in one single call however this approach is pretty painful this packge makes interfacing with js very very easy consider the tradeoffs and choose what is best for you ","srmadrid/zgm":"zig

in perspective this is probably already the 10th iteration i have written and i finally got a decent structure down that i assume to be scalable and maintainable anyway dont underestimate the project of writing a cli argument parser that supports subcommands flags with multiple value syntax compound flags and positional arguments this project tested my limits again and agian and even made me consider using a peg or regular expression parser  also  its not like i started programming yesterday notably the api took me some time to figure out which is funny considering its simplicity every single stage of this project tested me and my idealistic bedofroseloving ass considering all ive just said id recommend writing an argument parser once in your life  it just makes you feel cured of all previous projects or sad about your life choices  because i hated it especially in the final halfassed stages now that i succeeded more or less you may consider this my magnum opus of yak shaving

how to scaffold your first goku site once youve set up your site you can use goku to build it  goku site o build  in the above example goku will scan sitepages recursively for all md files parse their yaml frontmatter for a slug and then place the built sites into the build folder according to each pages slug it will provide a build summary with the time elapsed and the source and destination

contributions are welcome but i do request that if theres no open github issue regarding your ideal change that you open one first its likely that im already working on the feature so following this

","dasimmet/zig-libxml2":"libxml2 built using zig build system  libxml2 built with zig this repository contains zig code for building libxml2 using zig this allows other projects that use the zig build system to easily consume this library crosscompile it etc why using the zig build system makes it much easier to crosscompile a library even if you arent using the zig programming language see maintain it with zighttpskristoffitblogmaintainitwithzig for some more information this library currently hardcodes the libxml2 version latest as of writing this but unlikely to remain that way for long in the future id like to allow users to pass in a custom libxml2 directory and itd be really cool to setup some sort of github action to check for new versions and try to pull it in maybe one day  usage while we all eagerly await the zig package managerhttpsgithubcomziglangzigissues943 the recommended way to use this is via git submodules or just embedding this into your repository zig const libxml2  importpathtolibxml2zig pub fn buildb stdbuild void    const lib  try libxml2createb target mode   these are the minimal options to not depend on any other libraries  if you ave these libraries just set these to true iconv  false lzma  false zlib  false  const exe  baddexecutablemyprogram srcmainzig liblinkexe   this package does not provide any zignative apis to access the underlying c library this is by design the focus of this repository is only to enable building the underlying library using the zig build system therefore to use the library import the headers and use the c api zig const c  cimport cincludelibxmlxmlreaderh    do stuff with c   other dependencies some features require other libraries in the example above we disabled those features for example if you set zlib  true then zlib must be available in this scenario you can find and use a zlib build such as zigzlibhttpsgithubcommattnitezigzlib as normal when that library is also added to the project it adds its include paths and linking information to the build so libxml2 can be built with zlib support ","zigzedd/zrm":"[mirror] zig relational mapper. p aligncenter a hrefhttpscodezeptotechnetzeddzrm

boostcontext is a foundational library that provides a sort of cooperative multitasking on a single thread by providing an abstraction of the current execution state in the current thread including the stack with local variables and stack pointer all registers and cpu flags and the instruction pointer a executioncontext instance represents a specific point in the applications execution path this is useful for building higherlevel abstractions like coroutines cooperative threads userland threads or an equivalent to c keyword yield in c a fiber provides the means to suspend the current execution path and to transfer execution control thereby permitting another fiber to run on the current thread this state full transfer mechanism enables a fiber to suspend execution from within nested functions and later to resume from where it was suspended while the execution path represented by a fiber only runs on a single thread it can be migrated to another thread at any given time a context switch between threads requires system calls involving the os kernel which can cost more than thousand cpu cycles on x86 cpus by contrast transferring control among fibers requires only fewer than hundred cpu cycles because it does not involve system calls as it is done within a single thread boostcontext requires c11 ","retrodev256/jitter_rng":"this repository has no description.  say

safetythreadsafety  comparison spreadsheetcomparisonspreadsheet  speed benchmarksspeedbenchmarks  alternative implementationalternativeimplementation  markdowntoc   introduction this is a small headeronly library providing the uniqueownership smart pointers observableuniqueptr and observablesealedptr that can be observed with nonowning pointers observerptr this is a mixture of stduniqueptr and stdsharedptr it borrows the uniqueownership semantic of stduniqueptr movable noncopiable but allows creating observerptr to monitor the lifetime of the pointed object like stdweakptr for stdsharedptr the only difference between observableuniqueptr and observablesealedptr is that the former can release ownership while the latter cannot disallowing release of ownership enables allocation optimizations therefore the recommendation is to use observablesealedptr unless release of ownership is required these pointers are useful for cases where the sharedownership of stdsharedptr is not desirable eg when lifetime must be carefully controlled and not be allowed to extend yet nonowningweakobserver references to the object may exist after the object has been deleted note because of the unique ownership model observer pointers cannot extend the lifetime of the pointed object hence this library provides less safety compared to stdsharedptrstdweakptr see the thread safetythreadsafety section this is also true of stduniqueptr and is a fundamental limitation of unique ownership if this is an issue simply use stdsharedptrstdweakptr  usage this is a headeronly library requiring a c17compliant compiler you have multiple ways to set it up  just include this repository as a submodule in your own git repository and use cmake addsubdirectory or use cmake fetchcontent then link with targetlinklibrariesyourtarget public oupoup  download the header and include it in your own sources from there include the single header oupobservableuniqueptrhpp and directly use the smart pointer in your own code c include oupobservableuniqueptrhpp include string include iostream include cassert int main   nonowning pointer that will outlive the object

obtain an observer pointer to an object when you only have this ie from a member function you can inherit from oupenableobserverfromthisuniquet or oupenableobserverfromthissealedt depending on the type of the owner pointer to gain access to the observerfromthis member function contrary to stdenablesharedfromthist this function is noexcept and is able to return a valid observer pointer at all times even if the object is being constructed or is not owned by a unique or sealed pointer also contrary to stdenablesharedfromthist this feature naturally supports multiple inheritance to achieve this the price to pay is that oupenableobserverfromthisuniquet uses virtual inheritance while oupenableobserverfromthissealedt requires ts constructor to take a control block as input thereby preventing t from being defaultconstructible copiable or movable if needed these tradeoffs can be controlled by policies see below  policies similarly to stdstring and stdbasicstring this library provides both convenience types oupobservableuniqueptrtdeleter oupobservablesealedptrt oupobserverptrt oupenableobservablefromthisuniquet oupenableobservablefromthissealedt and generic types oupbasicobservableptrtdeleterpolicy oupbasicobserverptrtobspolicy oupbasicenableobservablefromthistpolicy if the tradeoffs chosen to defined the convenience types are not appropriate for your use cases they can be finetuned using the generic classes and providing your own choice of policies please refer to the documentation for more information on policies in particular policies will control most of the api and behavior of the enableobservablefromthis feature as well as allowing you to tune the size of the reference counting object speedmemory tradeoff  limitations the following limitations are features that were not implemented simply because of lack of motivation  this library is not threadsafe contrary to stdsharedptr see the thread safetythreadsafety section for more info  this library does not support pointers to arrays but stduniqueptr and stdsharedptr both do  this library does not support custom allocators but stdsharedptr does  thread safety this library uses reference counting to handle observable and observer pointers the current implementation does not use any synchronization mechanism mutex lock etc to wrap operations on the reference counter therefore it is unsafe to have an observable pointer on one thread being observed by obs","liyu1981/translate_c_extract":"a simple tool to clean zig translate-c result with annotation.  translatecextract a

basis for c++20's std::ranges (uses zig build-system) rangev3  range library for c141720 this code was the basis of a formal proposalhttpsericnieblergithubiostdwg21d4128html to add range support to the c standard library that proposal evolved through a technical specification and finally into p0896r4 the one ranges proposalhttpswg21linkp0896r4 which was merged into the c20 working drafts in november 2018 about  ranges are an extension of the standard template library that makes its iterators and algorithms more powerful by making them composable unlike other rangelike solutions which seek to do away with iterators in rangev3 ranges are an abstraction layer on top of iterators rangev3 is built on three pillars views actions and algorithms the algorithms are the same as those with which you are already familiar in the stl except that in rangev3 all the algorithms have overloads that take ranges in addition to the overloads that take iterators views are composable adaptations of ranges where the adaptation happens lazily as the view is iterated and an action is an eager application of an algorithm to a container that mutates the container inplace and returns it for further processing views and actions use the pipe syntax eg rng  adapt1  adapt2   so your code is terse and readable from left to right documentation  check out the woefully incomplete documentation
